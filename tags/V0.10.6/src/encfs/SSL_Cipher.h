/*
    Implements Cipher interface for OpenSSL's ciphers.

    Design:
    Variable algorithm, key size, and block size.

    Partial blocks, keys, and names are encrypted using the cipher in a pseudo
    stream mode (CFB).

    Keys are encrypted with 2-4 (KEY_CHECKSUM_BYTES define) checksum bytes
    derived from an HMAC over both they key data and the initial value vector
    associated with the key.  This allows a good chance at detecting an
    incorrect password when we try and decrypt the master key.

    File names are encrypted in the same way, with 2 checksum bytes derived
    from an HMAC over the filename.  This is done not to allow checking the
    results, but to make the output much more random.  Changing one letter in a
    filename should result in a completely different encrypted filename, to
    help frustrate any attempt to guess information about files from their
    encrypted names.

    Stream encryption involves two encryption passes over the data, implemented
    as:
        1. shuffle
        2. encrypt
	3. reverse
	4. shuffle
	5. encrypt
    The reason for the shuffle and reverse steps (and the second encrypt pass)
    is to try and propogate any changed bits to a larger set.  If only a single
    pass was made with the stream cipher in CFB mode, then a change to one byte
    may only affect one byte of output, allowing some XOR attacks.

    The shuffle/encrypt is used as above in filename encryption as well,
    although it is not necessary as they have checksum bytes which augment the
    initial value vector to randomize the output.  But it makes the code
    simpler to reuse the encryption algorithm as is.
